            <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew Rametta</h1>
            <p>
              I am a full-stack web developer, living in Tampa, FL. My developer
              background includes building full stack applications from the
              ground up, updating code to add features and fix bugs, and
              creating useful tools that benefit the users. I spent the first
              part of my career in the nonprofit world. My passion for work has
              always come from the drive to help people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am looking for a great team to join. I enjoy working with others
              and believe that two heads are always better than one. I think
              having a diverse group of people with vastly different
              perspectives makes for the most creative teams.I bring a unique
              perspective through my experiences in the nonprofit world. My
              favorite thing about software development is knowing I will never
              know everything. I am a lifelong learner, and it excites me to
              know that learning is a part of the job.

            <p>
              From the first time I printed "Hello World" in my console I was
              hooked! I became a software developer because I wanted a career
              that required me to use my brain to help solve problems that make
              people's lives better. I have always sought out opportunities and
              challenges that are meaningful to me. My professional path has
              taken many twists and turns to get to where I am today. My work as
              a pastor at a church gave me the skill of listening to others and
              wearing many hats. Working at Lululemon for five years helped me
              grow attention to detail while folding yoga pants and leading a
              visual merch team. My most recent experience as a fundraiser for
              nonprofits has taught me what motivates people. Throughout this
              crazy journey, I've never stopped engaging my passion for helping
              others and solving problems along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I’m not coding, I am usually sweating in a small hot
              darkroom, doing yoga. I can’t go a day without reading
              <i>Goodnight Goodnight Construction Site</i> to my 2 year old son
              at least five times in a row. The kitchen is my favorite room in
              the house. I like to open up my fridge and pretending I am
              competing on an episode of Chopped. The motto I live my life by is
              Hakuna Matata.
            </p>
            <p>
              My current focus is in Accessibility, React, and Design Systems.

            <h3>Daily Gratitude</h3>
            <p>
              "Something as simple as writing down three things your are
              grateful for every day for 21 days in a row significantly
              increases your level of optimism, and it holds for the next six
              months." - Shawn Anchor Daily Gratitude is a gratitude journal web
              application where you can log three daily gratitude entries. Our
              hope is that as you make this a part of your daily routine, you
              will start to feel more optimism toward your life as you focus on
              and remind yourself of those things that you are grateful for.
